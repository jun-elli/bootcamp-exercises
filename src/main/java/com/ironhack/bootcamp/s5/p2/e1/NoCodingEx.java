/**
 * Imagine that you work at a company that sets up automation for large offices.
 * Every automated task earns your company $0.70 + a service fee of $0.10.
 * How much money will your company make from 1
 * client if the average client requires 400 tasks?
 * Suppose you can run tasks for 20,000 clients per day. Roughly how much do you make daily?
 * Now suppose you have 90% uptime on your company system so you run tasks 328 days per year.
 * How much is your company pulling in annually?
 *
 * This exercise is designed to emphasize the real impact of the loss of precision in floating-point math.
 * The average revenue per client is $320, the average per day is $6,400,000 and
 * the annual average is $2,099,200,000. With a 1 cent cost reduction, the company makes $2,072,960,000 annually,
 * a loss of $26,240,000.
